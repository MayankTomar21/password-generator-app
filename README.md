# password-generator-app

Prerequisites:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

Approach:
Create an HTML form to capture user preferences for password generation, such as length and character types.
Use CSS to style the form and make it visually appealing.
Write JavaScript code to handle form submissions and generate passwords based on user preferences.
JavaScript generates a random password based on user-selected options (lowercase, uppercase, digits, and specials) and length. It allows copying the generated password to the clipboard.
Implement a function that generates a random password using the selected character types and lengths.
Display the generated password on the webpage for the user to see and copy.
Add event listeners to handle user interactions and trigger password generation.
